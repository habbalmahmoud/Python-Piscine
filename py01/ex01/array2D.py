This function accepts a 2D array (a list of lists) along with start

It first verifies that the input is a valid 2D array where each
inner list has the same length.
Then, it prints the shape of the array (number of rows and number of columns)
and returns a new
2D array in which each inner list has been sliced using Pythonâ€™s
slicing syntax (from 'start'
index (inclusive) to 'end' index (exclusive))."""
